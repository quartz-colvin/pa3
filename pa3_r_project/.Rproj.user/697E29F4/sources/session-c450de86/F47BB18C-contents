## Setup

First, load the data you want to work with.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library("tidyverse")
library("ds4ling")

data(package = "worldlanguages")

```

This is the data set I'll work with

```{r}
#| label: master_dataset

dataset <- worldlanguages::n_languages_by_country

```

## Tidy the data set

This one is already tidy and organized!

```{r}
#| label: tidy_dataset
#| message: false
#| warning: false

knitr::kable(dataset,
  caption = "Language data by country.") 
  
```


## Analyse the Data

Next, calculate descriptive statistics of your choice. Mean and median are already calculated for number of speakers. 

```{r}
#| label: variance
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# calculate variance 
knitr::kable(dataset |>
               select(nol_established, nol_immigrant, nol_total, nos_total) |>
               var(),
  caption = "Variance.") 

dataset |>
  mean(nol)

```

Then, select two continuous variables and fit a model to the data (bivariate regression). 

```{r}
#| label: model

mod <- lm(formula = nol_total ~ nol_immigrant, data = dataset)

summary(mod)

```

Generate a plot that includes a regression line.

```{r}
#| label: plot
#| message: false

dataset |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = nol_total, y = nol_immigrant)) +
      geom_smooth(method='lm', aes(x = nol_total, y = nol_immigrant), se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = 'Total languages', y = 'Immigrant languages') +
  labs(title = "Correlation between total number of languages and number of immigrant languages per country.")


```


## Observations 

Write up some general observations of the model and plot.
